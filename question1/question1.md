##Basic Scripting

- Download this dataset [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/freecodecamp/2016-new-coder-survey-) from Kaggle.
- Create a function that reads 100 records from the file per time based on a user supplied start index and a fixed query size of 100.
- Create a report of the following data per 100 records:
    - Highest level of education of new coders
    - Most Popular school major amongst new coders
    - Percentage of new coders who owe student debt and the average amount of student debt owed
    - Percentage of new coders that attended coding bootcamps versus the ones who didnâ€™t.


####Sample code
 ` def education_report(start_index):
        # Read from data file
        returns [HIGHEST_LEVEL_OF_EDUCATION, MOST_POPULAR_SCHOOL, PER

        CENTAGE_OWING_STUDENT_DEBT, PERCENTAGE_THAT_ATTENDED_CODING_BOOTCAMPS] `
